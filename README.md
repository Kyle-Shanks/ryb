# ryb

This is ryb. A clone of a pretty neat indie game called Haiki. 
ryb is a puzzle platformer where you try to traverse levels of increasing difficulty as a small square. The main mechanic of the game is that you have the ability to change the color of the background, which allows you to pass through objects of the same color.
